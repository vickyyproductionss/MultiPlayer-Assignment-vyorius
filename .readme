Simple multiplayer game

Use unity version 2022.3.3f1 to explore the project

You'll see two scenes named: "Menu" and "Game"
"Menu" Scene will let you create a new room by giving new room a name,
You can also join a pre-existing room which will be also listed under join room panel which you can access by clicking on join room.
By default the room is created with a player capacity of 10 you can change that if want by going to PhotonManager.cs
By default player will be assigned a random name like "Player532" unless he sets that name under inspector of PhotonManager.cs,
Name setting will be helpful because at the end of game winner name will be displayed to all losers.

Only Masterclient or the person who created the room can start the game.

Once the game is started all the player will go to "Game" scene where they can destroy a box by clicking on that box.
First player to destory 8 boxes will be winner.
